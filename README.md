# DST Base Image
This image is simply just a downloaded Don't starve together server tagged with the version from DST's release page for tracking: https://forums.kleientertainment.com/game-updates/dst/ I wanted to seperate this from the actual runtime image so that the build time of waiting for steamcmd to install is isolated to just this intermediary step.




To build the current version simply run release.sh



Requires bs4 python module.
